# Testing maze generation and solving

> Work in Progress

Create a maze on our LED matrix and find a way to fly our drone through it.

## Compile

> Tested on Linux only! This probably won't work on Windows.

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to compile:

```bash
make
```

## Execute

> Tested on Linux only! This probably won't work on Windows.

Run: 

```bash
./maze <rows> <cols> <startX> <startY> <exitX> <exitY>
```

## TODO

see [maze.c](./maze.c)
